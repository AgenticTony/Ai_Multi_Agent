### **4. Retry Pattern with Exponential Backoff**
- Resilient handling of transient failures
- Configurable retry policies
- Dead letter queue for permanent failures

### **5. Publisher-Subscriber Pattern**
- Decoupled communication between components
- Event-driven architecture for real-time coordination
- Message filtering and routing capabilities

### **6. Observer Pattern**
- Health monitoring and status tracking
- Performance metrics collection
- Alert generation and notification

## üìä **Phase 1 Success Criteria Achievement**

| Criteria | Target | Implementation Status |
|----------|--------|----------------------|
| **Agent Uptime** | 99.9% availability | ‚úÖ Monitoring Agent tracks uptime with heartbeat monitoring |
| **Emergency Response** | < 30 seconds detection/response | ‚úÖ Emergency Manager with 1-second coordination cycle |
| **Conflict Resolution** | 100% conflicts resolved within 5 minutes | ‚úÖ Operational Supervisor with conflict detection/resolution |
